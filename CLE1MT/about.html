        <p> </br></br></br></br> &nbsp&nbsp The creator of this is RUSS ALLEN S. GARDE. This webpage aims to spread awareness to people, especially the young ones who are new to voting. When choosing who the right person is for a particular position,
                        we must study their background. Know who they are, do they have negative aspects? Do they have any criminal records? Are they the perfect one for the position? When voting for a president, we must 
                        figure out everything about their political background and who they are as a person as well. People might have different views regarding their chosen candidates, but we must stay vigilant and loyal to our country, not the politicians. We must end our country's suffering and hope for change, change that will give birth to a new Philippines, free from crimes and poverty.
