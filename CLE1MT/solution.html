        <p> </br></br></br></br> &nbsp&nbsp For people to be aware and updated, we must stay vigilant for fake news. Fake news are one of the most common and popular thing that goes around the place, especially social media.                            People who aren't aware tend to share false news, thus resulting to people believing it and, therefore, spreading it also. This can be a crucial thing when it comes to politics, as people                              might vote for the wrong person and it can have a negative impact to our country. To give solution to fake news, we must fact-check things that are spreading online. Does it come from a                                reliable source, is the person who shared this credible, is the website reliable, etc. To avoid corruption and bad governance, we must be able to distinguish fake from real, especially in a                            world full of greedy people.
