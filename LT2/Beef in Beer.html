<img src="beefinbeer.jpeg" title="Beef in Beer" alt= "Beef in Beer" width="450" height="300">
<h1> INGREDIENTS </h1>
<ul>
	<li> 500g of cheap beef pieces (stewing steak usually is cheap) </li>
	<li> 500 ml of real ale</li>
	<li> 4 large onions </li>
	<li> 2 fat cloves of garlic </li>
	<li> tbsp of plain flour </li>
</ul>

<h1> METHOD </h1>
<ol>
	<li> Raw beef, roll it in the flour... fry 4-5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to seal... put to one side when all done. </li>
	<li> Cut the onions into quarters... fry in the same frying pan as the beef... to soak up the juices. </li>
	<li> Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic. </li>
	<li> Transfer the beef, onions, garlic, to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour. </li>
	<li> Pour on the bottle of beer - really, it isn't going to be wasted! </li>
	<li> Cover and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours... will be gorgeous when it comes out, trust me... serve with mash. </li>
</ol>
